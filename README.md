# Mini-Ajax-Project
Simple AJAX project to practice dynamic data flow

## What it does
It reads data from a free endpoint on a host repo and  using an `onclick()` handler adds data formatted from JSON into html of the container and applies styles to it without a page refresh.
This makes use of XMLHttpRequest() and JSON with AJAX
A jQuery method enabling CORS has also been implemented

## Homage to the Creator
This code was made by following along with a video from youtube and then experimenting with different things on top of it.
I would like to give credit to the content creator **LearnWebCode** so I am attaching the link to their video and twitter handle in case whoever reads this wants to go to the source.
