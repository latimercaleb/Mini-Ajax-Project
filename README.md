# Mini-Ajax-Project
Simple AJAX project to practice dynamic data flow and experiment with less.css

## What it does
It reads data from an endpoint and onclick() adds data formatted in JSON to the html page applying less.css styles to it without a page refresh.

This makes use of XMLHttpRequest() and JSON with AJAX, as well as less.css to precompile and render css on the dom.

## Homage to the Creator
This code was made by following along with a video from youtube and then experimenting with different things on top of it.

I would like to give credit to the content creator LearnWebCode so I am attaching the link to their video and twitter handle in case whoever reads this wants to go to the source.
